# 3D U-Net for Volumetric Segmentation

## Overview

This directory contains an implementation of the 3D U-Net model for volumetric segmentation, based on the paper "3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation" by Özgün Çiçek et al. (2016). The model is designed to work with 3D medical imaging data, such as MRI or CT scans, and is capable of segmenting volumetric structures.

## Architecture

The 3D U-Net architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, allowing for precise localization and dense prediction. The encoder captures context through convolutional layers and downsampling, while the decoder reconstructs the spatial resolution using upsampling and concatenation with encoder features.

### Encoder

- Composed of repeated applications of two 3x3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU activation and a 2x2x2 max pooling operation for downsampling.

### Bottleneck

- Connects the encoder and decoder with two 3x3x3 convolutions followed by a ReLU activation.

### Decoder

- Each step in the decoder involves upsampling the feature map, concatenating with the corresponding encoder feature map, and applying two 3x3x3 convolutions followed by a ReLU activation.

## Data Loader

The data loader is designed to handle 3D volumetric data stored in NIfTI format. It loads images and labels, applies any specified transformations, and returns batches of data for training or evaluation.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**

   - Organize your dataset with images and labels in separate directories, using NIfTI format.

2. **Load the Data**

   ```python
   from unet3d.dataloader import get_dataloader
   image_dir = 'path/to/images'
   label_dir = 'path/to/labels'
   dataloader = get_dataloader(image_dir, label_dir, batch_size=2)
   ```

3. **Initialize and Run the Model**
   ```python
   from unet3d.model import UNet3D
   model = UNet3D(in_channels=1, out_channels=2)
   for images, labels in dataloader:
       outputs = model(images)
       # Add your training loop here
   ```

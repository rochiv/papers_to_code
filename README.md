# Papers to Code: Replicating Research Papers with Code

## Project Overview

The `papers_to_code` project aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical implementation by replicating well-known research papers into executable code. This project provides a hands-on learning experience by allowing users to explore and understand the intricacies of state-of-the-art models through sample data and code.

## Goals

- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for students, researchers, and practitioners to understand and implement complex models.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that the implementations are faithful to the original papers, promoting reproducibility in research.
- **Community Contribution**: Encourage contributions from the community to expand the repository with more paper implementations.

## Current Implementations

1. **Pix2Pix: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for Image-to-Image Translation**
   - Explore the Pix2Pix model, which uses a conditional GAN for translating images from one domain to another.
   - [Detailed README](pix2pix/README.md)

2. **2D U-Net for Image Segmentation**
   - Delve into the U-Net architecture, a popular model for biomedical image segmentation.
   - [Detailed README](unet2d/README.md)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/papers_to_code.git
   cd papers_to_code
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Each sub-project contains a `requirements.txt` file. Navigate to the desired project directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Code**
   - Follow the instructions in each sub-project's README to run the code with sample data.

## Contributing

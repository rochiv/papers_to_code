# Pix2Pix: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for Image-to-Image Translation

## How Pix2Pix CGAN Works

1. **Conditional GAN Architecture**
   - Pix2Pix is a conditional GAN, where both the generator and discriminator are conditioned on an input image.
   - This allows the model to learn a mapping from one image domain to another.

2. **Generator: U-Net Architecture**
   - The generator uses a U-Net architecture with skip connections.
   - This preserves low-level details from the input image in the output.

3. **Discriminator: PatchGAN**
   - The discriminator uses a PatchGAN architecture.
   - It focuses on high-frequency details, improving the quality of generated images.

4. **Training Process**
   - Implement a combined loss for the generator:
     * L1 loss (pixel-wise difference)
     * Adversarial loss (fooling the discriminator)
   - Implement an adversarial loss for the discriminator.
   - Alternate training steps between generator and discriminator.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize images to the range [-1, 1].
   - This step is crucial for proper model training.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Use appropriate learning rates.
   - Consider implementing learning rate scheduling for better convergence.

7. **Training Monitoring**
   - Keep track of both generator and discriminator losses during training.
   - This helps in identifying training issues and assessing model performance.

8. **Model Evaluation**
   - Qualitative evaluation: Visual inspection of generated images.
   - Quantitative evaluation: Use metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).
